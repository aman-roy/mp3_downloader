# Revisions by Michael Gilbert:

I have ported the entire script to be compatible with BOTH python 3
AND python 3.

All functionality is kept between the 2 versions of python. There is a 
slight hang for certain songs when downloading. I will work on hastining
this process up.

I also need to create a function for a progress bar. You do not get one
when using urllib, only when using wget. Without wget, you have a more
portable script.
